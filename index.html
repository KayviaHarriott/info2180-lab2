                    <p id="articleParagraph"> Shang-Chi and the Legend of the ten Rings is the most recent (and 25th Marvel) movie to be released to Jamaica. The movie
                        focuses on Shaun, a valet parker who works with his best friend Katy. In the introduction of the the movie we are given flashbacks of Shaun's past which hints
                        at the future danger he's to face throughtout the movie. Shang-Chi and The Legend of Ten Rings has been highly rated after it's release even obtaining a 
                        score of 92% on the popular rating site Rotten Tomatoes. According to Wikepedia and various news sources the movie has been rated as the 5th highest grossing film of 2021. With all
                        it's success this poses the question what makes Shang-Chi so popular? While a large amount of the popularity may be a result of it being the premier of a new Marvel character in the franchise,
                        Shang-Chi also gained attention for it's soundtrack recorded with hit artists such as Mark Tuan, Saweetie and Rick Ross which brought attention to the film before trailers had been released

                    <p id="articleParagraph">With Spider-Man: No Way Home right around the corner Marvel fans are excited for the new release which could possibly have the return of 
                        Toby Maquire and Andrew Garfield as Spider-men from alternate universes/timelines. The film has confirmed a release date of December 17th, 2021 however directors 
                        have not given any hint to the speculations of fans as to wether Maquire and Garfield will reprise their roles. No Way From Home focuses on Peter (played by Tom Holland)
                        and the struggle he faces after his identity as the man behind the mask of Spider-Man has been revealed. With the aid of Dr. Strange, Peter may be given a second chance
                        at his identity becoming private again but it may cost him everything he's earned. Fans however have speculated that the Dr. Strange in the trailer may actually not be the Dr. Strange
                        we've known but instead a doppelganger/version of Strange that we have previously seen in Marvel's 'What If' series. Click <a href="url">here</a> to read more!
